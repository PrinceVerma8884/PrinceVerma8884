ðŸ‘‹Hi there! I'm a 2nd-year Master of Computer Applications (MCA) student, pursuing my passion for technology and software development. 
I completed my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Applications (BCA) and my 10th and 12th grades at Archies Higher Secondary School.

ðŸ’» I'm deeply interested in full-stack web development and am constantly working on enhancing my skills in both front-end and back-end technologies. 
Currently, I'm developing a student attendance management system using React, MongoDB, and Electron.

ðŸŒŸ My ambition is to become a proficient full-stack web developer, capable of creating robust and scalable web applications. 
I'm always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute to the open-source community.

âœ¨ Aside from coding, I enjoy reading about the latest advancements in tech, exploring new tools and frameworks, and participating in coding challenges.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas. Let's build something amazing together!
